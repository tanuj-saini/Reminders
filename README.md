*Project Name: Reminder App*

*Description:

The Reminder App is a powerful and user-friendly mobile application designed to help users remember to purchase specific items when they are in close proximity to the stores that sell them. With its intuitive interface and location-based reminders, this app ensures that you never forget to buy what you need when you are near the right place.

*Key Features:*

1. *Location-Based Reminders*: The core functionality of the app revolves around setting reminders based on your current location. Simply input the item you want to purchase and the location of the store, and the app will do the rest.

2. *Proximity Alerts*: The app constantly monitors your location, and when you approach within approximately 200 meters of the specified store, it sends you a timely notification. This notification serves as a reminder to purchase the item you've been meaning to buy.

3. *Customizable Reminders*: Users can easily create, edit, or delete reminders. The app allows you to customize the reminder message, the store's name.

4. *Map Integration*: For added convenience, the app integrates with maps to help you locate nearby stores and navigate to them effortlessly.
